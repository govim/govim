# Test that our workaround for gopls incorrectly returning an error when there are no
# completions results has done its job (of working around the bug)
#
# The fix in 4484754fb9ffd26fa2f1dedd8dce9e3656135b3d and this test should be reverted
# when https://github.com/golang/go/issues/31301 is addressed.
