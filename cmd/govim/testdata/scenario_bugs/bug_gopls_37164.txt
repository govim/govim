# Test the racing of gopls' usages of go/packages which result in racey usages of
# cmd/go modifying go.mod. More detail in:
#
#   https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36772#issuecomment-578933218
#
# and preceding comments. The test below is an exact copy of the setup that triggered
# this failure. The go.mod is intentially "dirty" such that any calls to cmd/go
# will cause the require directive to be added. One such call happens in the initial
# workspace load, the other is triggered by GOVIMGoToDef if the initial call has not
# yet completed. Hence the two race to update go.mod
