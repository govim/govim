# A test that causes a failure similar to the scenario described by:
# https://github.com/golang/go/issues/36144. This is marked as "skip" because
# otherwise we would continually break the govim build. The issue has been
# reported, its implications and severity are known, so there is no value in
# having a red CI build.
#
# What's critical here is that the go.mod file is incomplete; it is missing
# the go directive. Hence on the initial load that file gets changed, which
# triggers a file watcher event in govim, which triggers a recalculation of
# diagnostics when the go.mod file is changed, which sometimes causes a
# cancellation of the initial diagnostics for the package, or the diagnostics
# that are sent when a file is opened.
